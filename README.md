# Adult Census Income Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for the Adult Census Income Prediction project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on various demographic and socioeconomic features.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Adult Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains a set of attributes for each individual, including age, education, marital status, occupation, and more. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set.

The dataset is provided in CSV format and is included in the data directory of this repository. The training set is stored in the file train.csv, and the test set is stored in the file test.csv.

# Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the notebooks)

# Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the UCI Machine Learning Repository for providing the Adult Income dataset for research purposes.
